# React Typing Test

See how fast you can type within a minute! View your WPM, CPM, and accuracy rate. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Purpose

Become familiar with React framework and managing state.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- HTML
- CSS
- React Bootstrap

## Challenges Encountered

- Properly managing parent/children components as code-base grew
- Confusion on what I can or cannot pass as props. Initially I tried passing the actual state, which either errored out or showed it as a read-only value. However, I eventually learned to pass state/functionality using setState via functions.
